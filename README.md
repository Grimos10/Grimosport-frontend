# Frontend Grimosport project

Preamble: this is a university project for the "Tecnologie Web" (Web Technology) exam. The project is a web application for a sports shop. The project is divided in two parts: the backend and the frontend. This is the frontend part. The backend part is available at this [link](https://github.com/Grimos10/Grimosport-backend) where you can find the thesis of the project with some screenshots of the application.


I decided, just for fun and not beacuse it was necessary, to deploy the project on a server that I manage with a friend of mine, https://grimosport.grimos.dev
